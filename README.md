# Parallelization-with-Simulated Annealing
Parallelizing coding for feature selection process with simulated annealing

Feature selection is an NP-hard problem (Peng, Albuquerque, Kimura, & Saavedra, 2021), and there is no algorithm that can be used to solve it in polynomial time. Given the number of variables, we can find the number of variables(n) to the power of 2 = 2ùëõ for our feature
combinations.

In this project, we offer three metaheuristic methods for finding feasible solutions with a machine learning model (Support Vector Machine) for feature selection tasks: Simulated Annealing, Variable Neighborhood Search, and Genetic Algorithm. Finally, we summarise our findings and insights regarding the results through comparison and analysis.
