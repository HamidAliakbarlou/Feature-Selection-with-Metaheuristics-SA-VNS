# Feature-Selection-with-Simulated Annealing & VNS

#### Coding from scratch for feature selection process with Simulated Annealing & VNS:

Feature selection is an NP-hard problem (Peng, Albuquerque, Kimura, & Saavedra, 2021), and there is no algorithm that can be used to solve it in polynomial time. Given the number of variables, we can find the number of variables(n) to the power of 2 for our feature combinations.

In this project, we offer three metaheuristic methods for finding feasible solutions with a machine learning model (Support Vector Machine) for feature selection tasks: Simulated Annealing, Variable Neighborhood Search, and Genetic Algorithm. Finally, we summarise our findings and insights regarding the results through comparison and analysis.

## Dataset
Granting credit plays a key role in financial transactions. This task typically involves a lot of borrower-related variables. However, in many situations, having a large number of variables can introduce noise into the database when building predictive models. In this context, feature selection presents itself as a way to simplify a database by identifying key features, reducing computational costs, and improving prediction performance.
