The dataset we used for this project is the German Credit Data, which categorises loan applicants
as good or bad credit risks based on a set of attributes. There are 1000 observations in this
dataset, with 21 variables (7 numerical and 13 categorical), and no missing values. The target
variable Y is a binary variable with two levels: good credit and bad credit. If a loan applicant is
labelled as 0, it indicates that he or she has "bad credit" based on the 21 variables associated, or
vice versa. Each variable is described in detail in the appendix (Table 1: Description of the
dataset).
